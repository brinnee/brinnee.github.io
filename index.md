### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 part 1 was one of my favorites because of how simple it ended up being. In this lab we used for loops to produce a pattern in the terminal. This lab showed me the importance of thinking about what the output needed to be to be able to code to write code to produce the output.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 part 1 and 2 were among my favorites because it was the first time I had to read from a CSV file. This lab combined most of the concepts that we learned in our lecture like while loops, if statements, and condition statements. With all these concepts we took user input and saved it into a file that we could then access later.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10 was one of my favorites because we used different files for the first time. Part 3 was my favorite out of all the parts because we created our first picture. In part 3 we used for loops to go through the image and change each color of the pixels to make a gradient image.
